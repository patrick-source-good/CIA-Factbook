# Python_Learning
To learn how to code using Python, I wanted to work on something interesting rather than just doing the projects on YouTube. Over the last several years, I have tried to learn to code many times; each time, getting frustrated with not understanding the syntax or not having the knowledge to do what I wanted to do. In my professional work, I assist our data engineers in understanding how the different data types function in our system via the UI, which set me down the road of data analysis. This repository is a collection of projects I have done related to data analysis, primarily using the raw JSON data from the CIA Factbook. There are some projects here I have done for, fun such as the Days since Auburn beat UGA football program. All of the work shown in this repository is to show that I understand how to read code and problem solve issues in existing code. The code here is written with the assistance of ChatGPT. Rather than spinning my wheels and trying to learn everything at one time, I found it was more beneficial to my learning to use an AI chatbot. Using ChatGPT has allowed me to learn more about computer programming in the last month than I have been able to learn in the past several years.
