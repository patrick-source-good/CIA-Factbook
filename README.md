# CIA-Factbook
To learn how to code using Python, I wanted to work on something interesting rather than just doing the projects on YouTube. In my professional work, I assist our data engineers in understanding how the different data types function in our system via the UI, which set me down the road of data analysis. This repository is a collection of projects I have done related to data analysis, primarily using the raw JSON data from the CIA Factbook. The code here is written with the assistance of ChatGPT. Rather than spinning my wheels and trying to learn everything at one time, I found it was more beneficial for my learning to use an AI chat bot. Using ChatGPT has allowed me to learn more about computer programming in the last month than I have been able to learn in the past several years.
